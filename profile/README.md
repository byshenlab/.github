## About Us


### Overview
The BioNexus Platform (BP) is dedicated to advancing the field of bioinformatics through cutting-edge research, innovation, and collaboration. Our mission is to develop and apply computational tools and techniques to understand and interpret biological data, ultimately contributing to significant scientific discoveries and advancements in health and medicine. BioNexus signifies a comprehensive platform designed to be a central hub for bioinformatics research. It emphasizes the integration and connection of diverse biological data and tools, fostering an environment that supports innovative research and collaboration. The name conveys the idea of a powerful, user-friendly, and versatile platform that serves as a crucial point for advancing bioinformatics and biological sciences.

### Our Research
At BP, our research spans a wide range of topics in bioinformatics, including:

- **Genomics and Proteomics**: Analyzing DNA, RNA, and protein sequences to understand the structure, function, and evolution of genes and proteins.
- **Computational Biology**: Developing algorithms and computational models to simulate biological processes and systems.
- **Systems Biology**: Integrating data from various biological sources to construct comprehensive models of cellular and organismal function.
- **Data Mining and Machine Learning**: Utilizing advanced data analysis techniques to uncover patterns and insights from large biological datasets.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Applying AI and machine learning methods to enhance biological data analysis and interpretation.
- **Biostatistics**: Applying statistical methods to design experiments and analyze biological data.

### Our Team
Our team is composed of interdisciplinary experts, including biologists, computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians, all working together to push the boundaries of bioinformatics research. We are committed to fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment where diverse perspectives and expertise can thrive.

### Main Administrator
Prof. [Baiyong Shen](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B2%88%E6%9F%8F%E7%94%A8/3067940), our main administrator, leads the Bioinformatics Platform with extensive experience in bioinformatics and computational biology. 
- Prof. Shen has been working as a pancreatic surgeon for over 30 years. He and his teammates committed to exploring the pattern of tumorigenesis, development and metastasis in pancreatic cancer, aiming to improve the long-term survival of pancreatic cancer. Clinically, his pancreatic disease center is one of the largest national referral centers in the largest university hospital in the east of China. This center accomplished over 2000 pancreatic operations per year, including over 1300 pancreatic malignant tumor resections. They have also accomplished 2386 robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgeries so far, which is one of the largest cohorts worldwide. They also have some prospective clinical trials on the surgery methods and phase I/II adjuvant/palliative therapy on pancreatic disease ongoing. 
- Scientifically, through multiple advanced technologies, including high-throughput sequencing, protein profiling, spatial omics, molecular biology, and disease modeling approaches, they analyze the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis, metastasis and recurrence of pancreatic cancer and try to establish a multi-omics-based molecular classification of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. They are also interested in identifying the specific cell clusters of tumor microenvironment (TME) and understanding the biological and molecular characteristics of these clusters. The knowledge of the immunosuppressive microenvironment by revealing the subtypes and metabolic characteristics of immune cells helps us establish the stratified and targeted treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer.
